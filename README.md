# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
In this project, I assisted data journalist, Dana, with creating a dynamic website that presented findings on UFO sightings throughout the country. Through the use of Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, we created a great website that allowed users to filter the sightings data we acquired on certain dates. After we got the dynamic site and table working as expected, we wanted to allow users to drill more specifically into the sightings data through additional filters on city, state, country, and shape of the UFOs.

## Results
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
While our website and dynamic table have exceeded our expectations, one drawback of the new design is its limited amount of data. All of the UFO sightings we have at our disposal come from a single source, which is not nearly exhaustive.
